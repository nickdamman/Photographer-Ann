# Photographer-Ann
A website portfolio for the hobby photographer Ann Bultynck

This website serves as a portfolio for a photographer. The photographer in question here is Ann Bultnyck, a hobby photographer that will soon graduate from KISP in Ghent.

All of the animations on this website are made with GSAP from GreenSock and with the extra pluggin called ScrollTrigger, with a few exeptions.

Some things i still want to implement on the website:
  - Finish every page (finish every gallery + portfolio page).
  - A webshop for selling her photo's (wordpress).
